1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,610
The topics language skill takes

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,050
a body of text, whether they are

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,030
news reports, articles, emails,

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,710
or conversations, and extracts

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,510
a set of relevant topics.

6
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,010
Place your text here.

7
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,110
Next, drag the topic skill to

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,010
the pipeline.

9
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,470
Now run the pipeline.

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,090
The extracted topics will appear

11
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,470
in the output box to the right

12
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,490
above your text.

13
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,170
They're also listed at the bottom.

14
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,970
The generated code appears in

15
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,290
the box on the bottom left in

16
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,730
the framework of your choice.

17
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,410
Copy it here and paste it into

18
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,310
