Like.\n\nAgent  0:22\nYeah.\n\nProspect  0:23\nBut I really didn't get a chance to look at it yet.\n\nAgent  0:27\nYeah, no problem at all I just wanted to call to see, you know, if this is something that you're interested in, we could set up like, you know, 10 minutes for me to answer any questions that you have. Or if you want, we can see if it makes sense to, you know, set up like an actual flower of the product. But I wanted to reach out first and see what would be appropriate.\n\nProspect  0:49\nYeah, sure. I let me have a look into that. Actually, it sounded interesting to me, because we are also working on analytics here.\n\nAgent  0:59\nOf course, yeah. What are some of the things that you guys are looking for? I know, I mean, carrot soup, just as people become more data mature, you know, it becomes so important for, for companies to understand, you know, behavior of their users, and being able to track when there are event and things of that nature. So, yeah, I'd be happy to give you guys an overview. You want me to follow up like later this week? and then we can figure out, you know, timing is really like next week.\n\nProspect  1:28\nIf you Is it possible for you to call me on Friday by the time and have a look on the whole document which I have downloaded?\n\nAgent  1:36\nYeah. And we can have a more directed conversation for sure. What do you want me to give you a call at 1pm? I'm on pacific time as well.\n\nProspect  1:44\nYeah, 1pm would be fine. Okay,\n\nAgent  1:46\ncool. Sounds good. Well, I'll go ahead and add you on Farmvil. So you can put a name to the face and if anything changes, just let me know. But otherwise, I'll look forward to talking to you again on Friday.\n\nProspect  1:56\nYeah.\n\nAgent  1:58\nOkay, cool. Take care of on the way\n",
